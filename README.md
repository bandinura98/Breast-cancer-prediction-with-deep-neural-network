Breast cancer prediction with deep neural network

# Using the Wisconsin breast cancer diagnostic data set for predictive analysis

This project involves a deep learning model that classifies breast cancer as benign or malignant. With the fallowing attributes.

# Attribute Information:

1) ID number (never used)
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
4) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
5) perimeter
6) area
7) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
8) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
9). concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
10). concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
11). symmetry
12). fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
